# Introduction to NeoPKPD

<div class="hero-section">
<h2>Transparent, Validated PK/PD Modeling Infrastructure</h2>
<p>NeoPKPD is an open-source platform for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling, built for reproducibility, scientific rigor, and regulatory compliance.</p>
</div>

## What is NeoPKPD?

NeoPKPD is a comprehensive pharmacometrics platform that provides:

- **Validated PK/PD Models** - Industry-standard compartmental models with full mathematical transparency
- **Population Simulation** - Inter-individual and inter-occasion variability modeling
- **Parameter Estimation** - FOCE-I, SAEM, and Laplacian methods for NLME estimation
- **Non-Compartmental Analysis** - FDA/EMA-compliant exposure metrics
- **Clinical Trial Simulation** - Virtual trial design and power analysis
- **Professional Visualization** - Publication-ready plots with dual backend support

## Why NeoPKPD?

### Transparency
Every model equation, algorithm, and numerical method is documented and open for inspection. No black boxes.

### Reproducibility
JSON-serialized artifacts capture complete simulation state, enabling bit-exact reproduction across versions and platforms.

### Dual-Language Support
Write your analysis in Julia for maximum performance, or Python for seamless integration with data science workflows.

### Regulatory-Ready
NCA calculations follow FDA/EMA guidelines. VPC and diagnostic plots meet regulatory submission standards.

| Model | Compartments | Route | Key Application |
|-------|--------------|-------|-----------------|
| One-Compartment | 1 | IV/Oral | Simple kinetics |
| Two-Compartment | 2 | IV/Oral | Distribution phase |
| Three-Compartment | 3 | IV | Deep tissue binding |
| Transit Absorption | N+1 | Oral | Delayed absorption |
| Michaelis-Menten | 1 | IV | Saturable elimination |
| TMDD | 2-3 | IV | Target-mediated disposition |

### Pharmacodynamic Models

| Model | Type | Mechanism |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Direct Emax | Direct | Immediate response |
| Sigmoid Emax | Direct | Hill equation |
| Effect Compartment | Indirect | Biophase equilibration |
| Indirect Response (I-IV) | Indirect | Turnover modulation |
| Disease Progression | Complex | Biomarker dynamics |
