# FIH dose exploration

This use case models first-in-human dose exploration using a population PK model with covariates.

Purpose:
- Provide a realistic, reproducible workflow that maps to day-to-day PK decision making.
- Validate deterministic execution and artifact replay under a practical scenario.

Model:
- One-compartment IV bolus PK
- Parameters: CL, V
- Covariates:
  - WT on CL via power model exponent 0.75 (ref 70 kg)
  - WT on V via power model exponent 1.0 (ref 70 kg)

Population:
- Cohort weights: fixed list, deterministic
- IIV: log-normal on CL and V
- Seeded RNG

Scenarios:
- Dose levels: 10 mg, 30 mg, 100 mg, 300 mg (single dose)

Outputs:
- Concentration time series per individual
- Summary: mean, median, p05, p95
- Exposure metrics from mean curve: Cmax, AUC0-24

Validation:
- Artifacts generated by run.jl must replay exactly.
- Stored expected artifacts are compared via golden-style validation.
